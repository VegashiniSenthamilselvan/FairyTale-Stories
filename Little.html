        <p>A trusting little girl meets a scheming wolf on the way to her grandma's house.</p>

        <p>Once upon a time there lived on the borders of a great forest a woodman and his wife who had one little daughter, a sweet, kind child, whom every one loved. She was the joy of her mother’s heart, and to please her, the good woman made her a little scarlet cloak and hood, and the child looked so pretty in it that everybody called her Little Red Riding-Hood.</p>
       
        <p>One day her mother told her she meant to send her to her grandmother a very old woman who lived in the heart of the wood—to take her some fresh butter and new-laid eggs and a nice cake. Little Red Riding-Hood was very pleased to be sent on this errand, for she liked to do kind things, and it was so very long since she had seen her grandmother that she had almost forgotten what the dame looked like.</p>
        <p>The sun was shining brightly, but it was not too warm under the shade of the old trees, and Red Riding-Hood sang with glee as she gathered a great bunch of wild flowers to give to her grandmother. She sang so sweetly that a cushat dove flew down from a tree and followed her.</p>
        <p>Now, it happened that a wolf, a very cruel, greedy creature, heard her song also, and longed to eat her for his breakfast, but he knew Hugh, the woodman, was at work very near, with his great dog, and he feared they might hear Red Riding-Hood cry out, if he frightened her, and then they would kill him. So he came up to her very gently and said:</p>
        <p>“Good day, Little Red Riding-Hood; where are you going?”</p>
        <p>“To see my grandmother,” said the child, “and take her a present from mother of eggs and butter and cake.”</p>
        <p>“Where does your grandmamma live?” asked the wolf.</p>
        <p>“Quite in the middle of the wood,” she replied.</p>
        <p>“Oh! I think I know the house. Good day, Red Riding-Hood.” And the wolf ran off as fast as he couldLittle Red Riding-Hood was not in a hurry, and there were many things to amuse her in the wood. She ran after the white and yellow butterflies that danced before her, and sometimes she caught one, but she always let it go again, for she never liked to hurt any creature.</p>

        <p>And then there were the merry, cunning little squirrels to watch, cracking nuts on the branches of the old trees, and every now and then a rabbit would hurry away through the tall ferns, or a great bee come buzzing near her, and she would stop to watch it gathering honey from the flowers, and wild thyme. So she went on very slowly.
           
            <p>By-and-by she saw Hugh, the woodman.</p>
            <p>“Where are you going, Little Red Riding-Hood,” said he, “all alone?”</p>
            <p>“I am going to my grandmamma’s,” said the child. “Good day; I must make haste now, for it grows late.”</p>
            <p>While Little Red Riding-Hood was at play in the wood, the great wolf galloped on as fast as he could to the old woman’s house. Grandmother lived all by herself, but once or twice a-day a neighbour’s child came to tidy her house and get her food.</p>
            <p>Now, grandmother was very feeble, and often kept her bed; and it happened that she was in bed the day Little Red Riding-Hood went to see her. When the wolf reached the cottage door he tapped.</p>

            <p>“Who is there?” asked the old dame.</p>
            <p>“Well,” said Hugh, “when you were gone by, I remembered that a wolf had been seen about the wood lately, and I thought I would just come after you and see if you were safe. When we came near grandmother’s house my dog Trim sniffed and ran to the door and whined, and then he pushed it open—you had not shut it close—and rushed in, and I followed him, and between us we have killed the wolf.”</p>
            <p>Then Hugh took the child home, and her mother and father could not thank him enough for saving Little Red Riding-Hood.</p>
