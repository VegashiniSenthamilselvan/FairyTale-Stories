        <p>Once upon a time there was an old Sow with three little Pigs, and as she had not enough to keep them, she sent them out to seek their fortune.</p>
        <p>All three pigs decided to build a house, and set off to the brickworks to buy some bricks.</p>
        <p>But soon the three little pigs came across a Man carrying a bundle of straw.</p>
        <p>The first little pig said to himself:</p>
        <p>“Now I won’t need to walk so far to the brickworks! I’d much rather do less work, and then spend the rest of my afternoon relaxing.”So the first little pig said to the Man carrying straw:“Please, Man, give me that straw to build me a house.”</p>
        <p>The Man did, and the little Pig quickly built a house with it right where he stood, and then settled down and prepared to have a sleep for the rest of the afternoon.Presently came along a Wolf, and knocked at the door, and said, “Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.”</p>
        <p>To which the Pig answered, “No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin.”“Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in!” said the Wolf.</p>
        <p>So he huffed and he puffed, and he blew his house in. Alas! because the house had not been very well made, it fell down, and the wolf was able to eat the little Pig up in an instant.Meanwhile the second and third Pig were still on their way to the brickworks. When they passed a Man with a bundle of sticks, the second little Pig said to himself:</p>
        <p>“Now I won’t need to walk so far to the brickworks! Sticks are stronger than straw – I think they’ll do the job, but anyway, I’m tired now. I’d much rather do less work and then spend the rest of my afternoon relaxing.”</p>
        <p>So the first little pig said to the Man carrying the sticks:“Please, Man, give me those sticks to build me a house.”</p>
        <p>The Man did, and the little Pig quickly built a house with it right where he stood, and then settled down and prepared to have a sleep for the rest of the afternoon.Then along came the Wolf and said, “Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.”“No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin.”</p>
        <p>“Then I’ll puff and I’ll huff, and I’ll blow your house in!”So he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed, and at last he blew the house down, and ate up the second little Pig.</p>

        <p>Finally the third little Pig reached the brickworks, where he met a Man with a load of bricks. He said:“Please, Man, give me those bricks to build a house with.”</p>
        <p>The Man kindly gave him the bricks, and he built his house with them a little way over, carefully, and taking the time to do it well.</p>
        <p>So the Wolf came, as he did to the other little Pigs, and said, “Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.”</p>
        <p>“No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin.”</p>
        <p>“Oh, yes,” said the Pig, “I will go; what time shall you be ready?”</p>
        <p>“At three,” said the Wolf.</p>

        <p>So the little Pig went off before the time, as usual, and got to the Fair, and bought a butter churn, and was on his way home with it when he saw the Wolf coming. Then he could not tell what to do. So he got into the churn to hide, and in doing so turned it round, and it began to roll, and rolled down the hill with the Pig inside it, which frightened the Wolf so much that he ran home without going to the Fair.</p>
        <p>He went to the little Pig’s house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him.</p>
        <p>Then the little Pig said, “Hah! I frightened you, did I? I had been to the Fair and bought a butter churn, and when I saw you I got into it, and rolled down the hill.”</p>
        <p>Then the Wolf was very angry indeed, and declared he would eat up the little Pig, and that he would get down the chimney after him.</p>
        <p>When the little Pig saw what he was about, he hung on the pot full of water, and made up a blazing fire, and, just as the Wolf was coming down, took off the cover of the pot, and in fell the Wolf. And the little Pig put on the cover again in an instant, boiled him up, and ate him for supper, and lived happy ever after.</p>
