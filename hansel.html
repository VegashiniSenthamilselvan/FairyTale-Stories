        <center><h1>Hansel and Gretel</h1>
            <p>The classic fairytale about a clever brother and sister, and a gingerbread house...</p>

        <p>Near the borders of a large forest dwelt in olden times a poor wood-cutter, who had two children—a boy named Hansel, and his sister, Gretel. They had very little to live upon, and once when there was a dreadful season of scarcity in the land, the poor wood-cutter could not earn sufficient to supply their daily food.</p>
        <p>One evening, after the children were gone to bed, the parents sat talking together over their sorrow, and the poor husband sighed, and said to his wife, who was not the mother of his children, but their stepmother, “What will become of us, for I cannot earn enough to support myself and you, much less the children? What shall we do with them, for they must not starve?”</p>
        <p>“I know what to do, husband,” she replied. “Early to-morrow morning we will take the children for a walk across the forest and leave them in the thickest part; they will never find the way home again, you may depend, and then we shall only have to work for ourselves.”</p>
        <p>“No, wife,” said the man. “That I will never do. How could I have the heart to leave my children all alone in the wood, where the wild beasts would come quickly and devour them?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, you fool,” replied the stepmother. “If you refuse to do this, you know we must all four perish with hunger; you may as well go and cut the wood for our coffins.” And after this she let him have no peace till he became quite worn out, and could not sleep for hours, but lay thinking in sorrow about his children.</p>
        <p>The two children, who also were too hungry to sleep, heard all that their stepmother had said to their father. Poor little Gretel wept bitter tears as she listened, and said to her brother, “What is going to happen to us, Hansel?”</p>
        <p>“Hush, Grethel,” he whispered. “Don’t be so unhappy; I know what to do.”

            Then they lay quite still till their parents were asleep.
            
            </p>
            <p>As soon as it was quiet, Hansel got up, put on his little coat, unfastened the door, and slipped out. The moon shone brightly, and the white pebble stones which lay before the cottage door glistened like new silver money. Hansel stooped and picked up as many of the pebbles as he could stuff in his little coat pockets. He then went back to Gretel and said, “Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace; heaven will take care of us.” Then he laid himself down again in bed, and slept till the day broke.</p>
            <p>As soon as the sun was risen, the stepmother came and woke the two children, and said, “Get up, you lazy bones, and come into the wood with me to gather wood for the fire.” Then she gave each of them a piece of bread, and said, “You must keep that to eat for your dinner, and don’t quarrel over it, for you will get nothing more.”Gretel took the bread under her charge, for Hansel’s pockets were full of pebbles. Then the stepmother led them a long way into the forest. They had gone but a very short distance when Hansel looked back at the house, and this he did again and again.

                At last his stepmother said, “Why do you keep staying behind and looking back so?”</p>

                <p>Now the innkeeper had three daughters, who on seeing the goose were curious to know what wonderful kind of a bird it could be, and longed to have one of its golden feathers.</p>
                <p>“Oh, mother,” said the boy, “I can see my little white cat sitting on the roof of the house, and I am sure she is crying for me.”

                    “Nonsense,” she replied. “That is not your cat; it is the morning sun shining on the chimney-pot.”
                    
                    Hansel had seen no cat, but he stayed behind every time to drop a white pebble from his pocket on the ground as they walked.</p>
                    <p>His wife would listen to nothing he said, but continued to reproach him, and as he had given way to her the first time, he could not refuse to do so now. The children were awake, and heard all the conversation; so, as soon as their parents slept, Hansel got up, intending to go out and gather some more of the bright pebbles to let fall as he walked, that they might point out the way home; but his stepmother had locked the door, and he could not open it. When he went back to his bed he told his little sister not to fret, but to go to sleep in peace, for he was sure they would be taken care of.</p>
                    <p>Early the next morning the stepmother came and pulled the children out of bed, and, when they were dressed, gave them each a piece of bread for their dinners, smaller than they had had before, and then they started on their way to the wood.</p>
                    <p>As they walked, Hansel, who had the bread in his pocket, broke off little crumbs, and stopped every now and then to drop one, turning round as if he was looking back at his home.</p>
                    <p>“Hansel,” said the woman, “What are you stopping for in that way? Come along directly.”

                        “I saw my pigeon sitting on the roof, and he wants to say good-bye to me,” replied the boy.</p>
                        <p>“Nonsense,” she said; “that is not your pigeon; it is only the morning sun shining on the chimney-top.”But Hansel did not look back any more; he only dropped pieces of bread behind him, as they walked through the wood. This time they went on till they reached the thickest and densest part of the forest, where they had never been before in all their lives. Again they gathered faggots and brushwood, of which the stepmother made up a large fire. Then she said,“Remain here, children, and rest, while I go to help your father, who is cutting wood in the forest; when you feel tired, you can lie down and sleep for a little while, and we will come and fetch you in the evening, when your father has finished his work.”</p>
                        <p>So the children remained alone till mid-day, and then Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, for he had scattered his own all along the road as they walked. After this they slept for awhile, and the evening drew on; but no one came to fetch the poor children. When they awoke it was quite dark, and poor little Grethel was afraid; but Hansel comforted her, as he had done before, by telling her they need only wait till the moon rose. “You know, little sister,” he said, “That I have thrown breadcrumbs all along the road we came, and they will easily point out the way home.”</p>
                        <p>But when they went out of the thicket into the moonlight they found no breadcrumbs, for the numerous birds which inhabited the trees of the forest had picked them all up.</p>
                        <p>But how surprised were the boy and girl, when they came nearer, to find that the house was built of gingerbread, and ornamented with sweet cakes and tarts, while the window was formed of barley-sugar.</p>
                        <p>“Oh!” exclaimed Hansel, “let us stop here and have a splendid feast. I will have a piece from the roof first, Gretel; and you can eat some of the barley-sugar window, it tastes so nice.” Hansel reached up on tiptoe, and breaking off a piece of the gingerbread, he began to eat with all his might, for he was very hungry. Gretel seated herself on the doorstep, and began munching away at the cakes of which it was made. Presently a voice came out of the cottage.</p>
